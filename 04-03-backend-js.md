# Kotlin for JS runtimes

Thanks to Kotlin/JS (the compiler component that converts Kotlin into JS), Kotlin can be used with JS runtimes such as Node.js or Deno.
However, compared to JVM or Native, the JS target is not as mature, so we leave it as a bonus section.

## Node.js quick guide

We propose to follow [this guide from our Kotlin training](https://worldline.github.io/learning-kotlin/en/backend-development/#%F0%9F%A7%AA-getting-started-with-kotlin-js-and-express).
It guides you through the steps to create a simple REST API using Express.js and Kotlin.
