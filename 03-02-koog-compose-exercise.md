# Exercise: country info with AI

Add a feature to the app developed in Compose in Step 2 which relies on LLMs.
For example, you could use an LLM to provide information about a country when the user selects it in the list.
The information will be shown in a `Text` above the `LazyColumn`.

You can continue with the app that you worked on, or start from a solution available here: [02-frontend/compose-03-country-list-final-step](./02-frontend/compose-03-country-list-final-step/)
