## Part 2 - backend development

## Part 3 - Frontend development

- Expected duration: 30 minutes

Kotlin can be used for frontend development in several ways thanks to its multiplatform capabilities.
We are going to see two examples, one with JavaFx and one with Compose Multiplatform.

1. Compose Multiplatform [03-01-compose.md](./03-01-compose.md)
1. (Bonus) JavaFx with Kotlin: [03-02-javafx.md](./03-02-javafx.md)
