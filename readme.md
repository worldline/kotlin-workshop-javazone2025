- Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)
- It is also possible to follow this part by opening notebooks in GitHub and doing the exercises in the Kotlin Playground. 

1. Open this notebook to try some prominent Kotlin feature [01-01-kotlin-tour.ipynb](./01-01-kotlin-tour.ipynb)
1. Next, let's do some exercises that are listed in the file [01-02-exercises.ipynb](./01-02-exercises.ipynb) 
    - The solutions are available in [01-02s-solutions.ipynb](./01-02s-solutions.ipynb)

## Part 2 - Frontend development

- Expected duration: 30 minutes
- Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)

Kotlin can be used for frontend development in several ways thanks to its multiplatform capabilities.
We are going to see two examples, one with JavaFx and one with Compose Multiplatform.

1. Compose Multiplatform [03-01-compose.md](02-01-compose.md)
1. (Bonus) JavaFx with Kotlin: [03-02-javafx.md](02-02-javafx.md)

## Part 3 - backend development

- Expected duration: 30 minutes
- Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)

Kotlin supports JVM and JS frameworks.
In addition to that, also has Kotlin exclusive ones (that usually run on the JVM or native).

## Part 4 - Datascience

- Expected duration: 30 minutes
- Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)

With its support of Jupyter notebooks and availability of JVM (such as Spark) and Kotlin native analysis and plotting libraries, Kotlin is a great language for data science.


## Part 5 - GenAI programming
