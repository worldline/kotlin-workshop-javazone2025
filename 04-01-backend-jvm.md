# JVM frameworks for backend development

The most two popular JVM backend frameworks, namely Spring and Quarkus officially support Kotlin.
When using Kotlin on these frameworks, you retain all the benefits of the JVM ecosystem, such as Native image, Garbage collectors, Monitoring tools and Documentation.

Plus, you get all the benefits of the Kotlin language: Conciseness, Null safety, Extension functions, DSL and expressive test names.

## Spring and Quarkus guides

If you are already familiar with Spring or Quarkus, and already know some Kotlin, it should be easy to get started with Kotlin on these frameworks.
You just need to selected Kotlin as the language when creating a new project with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or [Quarkus code generator](https://code.quarkus.io/).

We also provide a [Spring](https://worldline.github.io/learning-kotlin/en/backend-development/#spring-framework) guide in our [Learning Kotlin](https://worldline.github.io/learning-kotlin/en/) site.
